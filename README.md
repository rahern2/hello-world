# hello-world
first github repository (how exciting!)

I have been a developer for 13 years.  Started out in QA as a QA Automation Engineer writing script for IBM Rational Robot to test against our VB based windows client software.  I then became a junior web developer and eventually became a Business Intellegence Engineer.
